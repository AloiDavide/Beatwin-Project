## Context: discovery circumstances 
In the morning [[Genji]] informs [[Rosa]] of the magic circles. When she gets there all servants except [[Kumasawa]] are present and they discuss how to get inside, then Rosa has a hunch that the key must be inside the letter.

## Axioms
- __Regardless of whether they were alive or dead, the six definitely entered trough the door__
- __Only one key to the chapel exists__!
- __It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with anything but the chapel's key__!!
- __When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit__!!
- __The six definitely entered trough 'this front door'__!!
- __This morning [[Rosa]] definitely took an envelope out of [[Maria]]'s handbag... and from that obtained the genuine key to the chapel__.
- - __The key to the chapel truly was the object inside the envelope I gave Maria__.
- - __The envelope I handed over to Maria and the one Rosa opened are the same thing__!!
- - __From the time Maria received her key to the instant Rosa unsealed the envelope the next day, the key passed through no one's hands!!__
- - __There were no doors with auto-locks other than [[Kinzo's study]]!__
- - __The six were already dead by the time they were discovered! All of their deaths were homicides! All six were genuine victims and did not take part in a mutual murder! There was no simultaneous murder!!__
- - __There was no one hiding in the chapel. Therefore, the shut-in murder you suggest does not work!__
- __When the six were murdered in the chapel, the culprit was inside the chapel__!

## Theorems
- When they passed through the door it had to be open
- There were at lest 7 people inside the chapel during the crime. The 6 plus their assassin.
- The 7th person has exited the room before they were found.
	- Or perhaps was dead. 

> [!question]+ Hypothesis
> The door of the Chapel was unlocked the entire time, so anybody could enter and exit without needing a key. 
> Then, the first person to discover the closed door lied about it being locked.
> 
> Hints:
> 
> Most of the servants and Rosa seemed to agree that the door was indeed locked, and were discussing breaking a window to enter. They would all need to either be in on the plan, or not have tried to open the door themselves.
> The amount of people involved  makes me less sure about this theory.
