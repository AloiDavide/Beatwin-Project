### Axioms
__Only the five master keys were left, and 'Rosa' was holding all of them__! __and let me say this: the parlor's the same__. __The key to the parlor itself is sealed away in the servant's room__. __So unlocking it without a master key is impossible! The definition of a closed room remains the same as always!__

> Who put the letter there?

> Leads:
> Someone might have just put the letter there, before they went away, possibly Rosa or Maria
